# MySensors Php API

This class implements methods to directly send messages (and get answers) to a [MySensors](http://www.mysensors.org) gateway.


### Main Files
- **example.php** : Basic usage example
- **form.php** : Send (or visually convert) messages to your Gateway
- **src/mysensors_bin.php** : an excecutable script to send/receive message from the command line
- **src/mysensors.class.php** : The main class
- **src/PhpSerial.php** : Serial handling [class by RÃ©my Sanchez](https://github.com/Xowap/PHP-Serial/)


### Sender / Converter Form
*form.php* allow you compose messages using convenient dynamic drowndown menu. resulting message is then shown in the message box.
You can also do the reverse action : type any text in the message box, and it will dynamically decode it.
Finally  you can also send the message to the gateway.

## Disclaimer
- Currently only the Ethernet Gateway is supposed to work. **The Serial Gateway if just a draft**, for somebody willing to test it and implementing correctly (Push  your PR!).
- Missing some detailed documentation about the MySensors messages protocol, some features may not work as expected (ie: the *req* command was not tested). So I won't be responsible if you'd burn your house or kill a cat by using this software! ;-)
